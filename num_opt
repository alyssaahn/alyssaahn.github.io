# Numerical Optimization and Exploration of the K-Means Problem 

During my undergraduate years, I recognized that I enjoyed courses in which I learned about the application of matrices within algorithms to solve mathematical questions. My final semester in college I ended up taking an Independent Study Course where we focused on both Numerical Optimization and Linear Programming. Below is the write up from that course in which I explore the K-Means Problem and the implications of relaxing required constraints around desired solutions.
