### Avery and Guppy 

Glad you made it! Avery is a Standard Issue Cat that loves basking in the sun and chasing feathers. Guppy is our Tuxedo Boy who can be found killing his octopus toy or chasing a spring. I can say with high likeliness that these cats are generally lounging somewhere near me or begging for food.
