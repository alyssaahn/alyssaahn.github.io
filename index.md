# About Me
Hello! My name is Alyssa Ahn. I am a Customer Success Account Manager at Microsoft. This is a repository of the projects and write ups I have put together in my free time. I enjoy Applied Mathematics, Privacy, Data Analysis and findings the beautiful intersections of the aforementioned. In my free time, I can be found biking the hills of the Bay Area, playing tennis, building a mechanical keyboard or hunting down my next cup of coffee.

### Avery and Guppy 

Glad you made it! Avery is a Standard Issue Cat that loves basking in the sun and chasing feathers. Guppy is our Tuxedo Boy who can be found killing his octopus toy or chasing a spring. I can say with high likeliness that these cats are generally lounging somewhere near me or begging for food.
